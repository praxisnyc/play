# praxis / play

A [hugo](https://gohugo.io/) theme environment for  stand-alone creative code experiments, reducing the learning curve so you can enjoy being in the zone.

Our goal to curate best practices (integrating, testing, documenting) to play with:

- processing
- p5js
- ml5js
- PWA (so it works well on mobile browsers)

## features

**praxis / play** provides an ever-growing list of ready-to-use features to speed up your creative code: Want text not to be selectable? Want to prevent zoom? ml5? smooth scroll?

Features are per page so you only load what you need, to ensure performance.
